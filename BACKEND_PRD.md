# FinUPI Backend - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

The FinUPI Backend serves as the intelligence layer for the FinUPI application, processing UPI transaction data to generate credit scores and loan recommendations. This document focuses specifically on the backend components, with emphasis on the AI-driven credit scoring system.

## 2. System Overview

The FinUPI Backend consists of:

1. **Transaction Processing Engine**: Ingests and normalizes UPI transaction data
2. **AI Credit Scoring Model**: Analyzes transaction patterns to generate creditworthiness scores
3. **Loan Management System**: Handles loan approvals, disbursements, and repayments
4. **Financial Education Recommendation Engine**: Provides personalized financial advice

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Transaction Data Processing

- Parse and validate uploaded transaction data (CSV/PDF/JSON formats)
- Categorize transactions (income, expense, transfers, round-trip payments)
- Extract merchant information and transaction patterns
- Generate transaction summaries and financial insights

### 3.2 AI Credit Scoring

- Calculate creditworthiness based on transaction history
- Analyze income stability and patterns
- Evaluate expense behaviors and financial discipline
- Detect financial risk indicators
- Generate explainable credit scores with component breakdown

### 3.3 Loan Recommendation System

- Determine appropriate loan amounts based on income and expenses
- Calculate reasonable interest rates based on risk assessment
- Estimate optimal loan duration and repayment schedules
- Provide transparent loan term explanations

### 3.4 Financial Education Engine

- Generate personalized financial insights based on transaction patterns
- Identify specific financial behaviors that need improvement
- Recommend actionable steps to improve creditworthiness
- Provide contextual financial education at relevant moments

## 4. AI Model Requirements

### 4.1 Core Model Capabilities

- **Transaction Classification**: Accurately categorize transactions as income, expense, or transfers
- **Round-Trip Payment Detection**: Identify and filter circular money movements
- **Income Pattern Analysis**: Detect regular income, variable income, and one-time payments
- **Expense Pattern Analysis**: Categorize spending and identify discretionary vs. essential expenses
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate financial vulnerability and repayment capacity
- **Score Generation**: Calculate a numeric score (0-100) reflecting creditworthiness

### 4.2 Model Features & Parameters

The AI model should analyze the following parameters:

1. **Income Stability (25%)**

   - Regularity of income (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)
   - Consistency of income amounts
   - Income sources diversity
   - Income growth/decline trends

2. **Expense Management (25%)**

   - Expense-to-income ratio
   - Essential vs. discretionary spending ratio
   - Consistency of essential payments (rent, utilities)
   - Large expense outliers

3. **Financial Discipline (25%)**

   - Regular savings patterns
   - Avoidance of frequent small loans
   - Avoidance of cash withdrawals before income dates
   - Balance maintenance patterns

4. **Transaction History (25%)**
   - Length of available transaction history
   - Transaction volume and frequency
   - Merchant diversity
   - Avoidance of high-risk merchants (gambling, etc.)

### 4.3 Model Training Requirements

- **Training Data**: Minimum 1,000 anonymized transaction histories with labeled creditworthiness outcomes
- **Validation**: Cross-validation techniques with at least 20% holdout data
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1 score for classification tasks; MSE for regression tasks
- **Explainability**: SHAP or LIME implementation for model explanation

## 5. Technical Implementation Phases

### 5.1 Phase 1: MVP Implementation (Hackathon)

- Merchant/counterparty information
- Transaction reference/ID
- Transaction description (if available)

### 6.3 Data Privacy & Security

- All transaction data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Personal identifiable information (PII) must be masked or tokenized
- Clear data retention policies must be implemented
- User consent must be obtained before data processing
- Compliance with relevant financial data regulations

## 7. Performance Requirements

- Credit score calculation: <10 seconds for initial score, <3 seconds for updates
- Loan recommendation: <2 seconds from request to display
- System availability: 99.9% uptime
- Concurrent users: Support for 1000+ simultaneous scoring requests

## 8. Integration Requirements

- Firebase/Firestore for user data storage
- Authentication systems integration
- Frontend API endpoints for data submission and retrieval
- Monitoring and logging systems
- Analytics platform integration for model performance tracking

## 9. Success Metrics

- Credit scoring accuracy: >85% correlation with repayment outcomes
- Transaction classification accuracy: >90%
- Income/expense detection accuracy: >95%
- User feedback on score explanation: >80% satisfaction
- Loan recommendation acceptance rate: >60%
- Default rate: <3% for approved loans

By implementing this backend system effectively, FinUPI will deliver accurate credit scores based on transaction history, enabling fair access to microloans while providing valuable financial insights to users.
